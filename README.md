# Spam-Classifier

Naive Bayes is a supervised classification technique based on Bayes' Theorem with an assumption of independence among predictors. That is, a Naive Bayes classifier assumes that the presence of a particular feature in a class is unrelated to the presence of any other feature.

It is a popular technique for text categorization, judging documents as belonging to one category or the other (such as spam or legitimate, sports or politics, etc.) with word frequencies as features.

## Steps Performed

1. Loading Data  
2. Data cleaning and preprocessing  
3. Creating the Bag of Words model  
4. Training model using Naive Bayes Classifier  
5. checking accuracy and confusion matrix of the model
